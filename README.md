# NextGen

The era of CRUD and tiers is gone. While still occasionally applicable, this vision of the software gets more obsolete every day. Software is pervasive and aims at taking 100% of our lives; no way we could afford planning and designing software the way we did for at least the last two decades. 

What’s new then?

Here’s a list of crucial keywords: events, micro-services, business processes, domain modeling. The demos here explore events and the silent revolution that events and commands are bringing to software. Demos show Event Sourcing, persistence, CQRS and frameworks. You'll find three different steps of a To-Do application (classic CRUD app revisited) built using a new event-based framework.
 
MementoFX is an application framework supporting the development of time travelling (TT) applications. A TT application is an application that uses events as the sole form of storage and builds any state and view out of events. TT is because at any time you can bring the time of the application back to a different day and see how it was. See https://github.com/MementoFX/MementoFX.
